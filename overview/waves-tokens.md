# Tokens Definition 

Tokens operate on top of a blockchain that facilitates the creation of decentralized applications.

In general, tokens are a reproduction of a particular asset or utility, which usually remains on top of another blockchain. Tokens can represent essentially any assets that are fungible and tradeable, from commodities to loyalty points to even other cryptocurrencies. Creating tokens is a much straightforward process as you do not need to modify the codes from a particular protocol or to create a blockchain from scratch. All you have to do to issue tokens is to follow a standard template on the blockchain such as on the Ethereum or on Waves platform which both allows you to create your own tokens. 



# The Main Deference Between Waves Tokens and Ethereum Tokens

## Waves Tokens

* Waves Platform empowers people with a non-coding background to develop tokens and even be able to launch their own ICOs without much hassle. The set-up is powered by WAVES tokens which enable users to transact over the platform.

* Waves enable you to create custom tokens, which means you can launch your own cryptocurrencies without any coding requirements.
* You can also decentralize trading and crowdfunding, as it has integrated fiat currency gateways like USD/EUR/CNY right in your wallet.
* Tokenization, you can make your own custom tokens or cryptocurrencies in one minute on the Waves platform and there are tools that make it incredibly easy to distribute new tokens and carry out various other activities. You will require at least 1 WAVES token to do so. You can decide what name to give the token, how many to be issued, and how many decimal fractions you want to keep. This is ideal for crowdfunding and ICOs.

## Ethereum Tokens

* Smart contracts, programmable computer codes that are self-executing and do not need any third-parties to operate.
* Ethereum remains the only truly viable solution for implementing these. No other smart contract platform has proven its utility, and none has the level of adoption that Ethereum does.
