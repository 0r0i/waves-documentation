# **Wallet Operations**

Waves allows you to hold and transfer WAVES, Bitcoin, Litecoin, Zcash, Ethereum, Euro, Dollar and other Waves Tokens on Waves blockchain. This works through a so-called Multi Gateway approach.

The user can send Bitcoins or another cryptocurrencies \( which are supported by Waves Client\) to another address within seconds. Moreover, it allows a cryptocurrency to be traded on the Waves decentralized exchange against any other token issued on the Waves blockchain.
