# Options for Getting Actual Blockchain

After a user install a node, the user will have different ways to get the blockchain as the following:

1. Build from scratch, here you will need to [_**run the node**_](/waves-full-node/how-to-install-a-node/how-to-install-a-node.md), then it will receive all the needed information from the other nodes.
2. [_**Import state**_](/waves-full-node/options-for-getting-actual-blockchain/export-and-import-from-the-blockchain.md), here the user needs to stop the node before starting the process of exporting the blocks.
3. [_**Downloading state**_](/waves-full-node/options-for-getting-actual-blockchain/state-downloading-and-applying.md).

**Note. **you can go through the links above for more details about each step..
