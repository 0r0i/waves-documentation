# Options of Running Waves Full Node

After a user install a node, the user will have different ways to get the blockchain as the following:

1. Build the blockchain from scratch, here you will need to [run the node](/waves-full-node/how-to-install-a-node/how-to-install-a-node.md), then it will receive all the needed information from the other nodes.
2. Import blockchain from binary file, here the user needs to stop the node before starting the process of exporting the blocks.
3. [Downloading exported blockchain](/waves-full-node/state-downloading-and-applying.md).
