# Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. Is smart contract functionality added in Waves ? If Yes, which languages are supported?

Yes, it's own language [_**RIDE**_](/smart-contracts/ride-language/ride-language.md).

### 2. Is it possible to convert an existing token to a smart token via a script, or must you implement a token swap?

Yes by using [_**smart assets**_](/smart-contracts/smart-assets.md) concept.

### 3. I don't know about account scripts. Do you know where I could find appropriate documentation?

The best is to start with [_**as a developer guide.        
**_](/getting-started/as-a-developer.md)

### 4. How many Tx does waves have? will SC add another transaction type to the wavesplatform? Where can I find a valid SetScript transaction from testnet?

There are [_**14 tx types**_](/waves-api-and-sdk/waves-node-rest-api/example-transactions.md) on Waves and publishing a script for an account is one of those \(type 13 SetScript Tx\).

### 5. Does Waves smart contracts have numbers similar Ethereum one's, 0x....?

No, but they are attached to accounts also, at least in the first version.

### 6. When you develop a dapp on Waves, is it more appropriate to have a private waves blockchain or just your own full node on the regular mainnet ?

Neither of both, you don't have to have a node for deploying a SC. Nevertheless, for the dev i would recommend to use testnet.
