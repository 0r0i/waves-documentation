## Overview

This page introduces you to the things you'll need to get started on your journey.

This will give you all the information you need as a developer to get started in an easy to read and concise format.

## Smart Contracts

Usually as a developer, you will need two things: **theoretical understanding** and **tools** to make your coding life easier, in our guide we will provide you with both:

_**Theoretical Understanding **_

You will need to know:

* how Waves smart contract works \(You can go through our [_**smart contract guide**_](/technical-details/waves-contracts-language-description.md)\_** **\_to get more information about it.\).

* Which programming language to use \(we're using our own language which called RIDE, [_**Get to know RIDE**_](/technical-details/ride-language.md)_**\)**_.

let's suppose now that you understand the main idea of our smart contracts and you want to go through all functions and to understand how they work, please find here our [_**functions and standard library**_](/technical-details/waves-contracts-language-description/standard-library.md).

_**Tools to help you with RIDE**_

In Waves, we always think about the best way to help external developers and because of that we will provide you with some useful tools:

* [_**Waves IDE **_](https://ide.wavesplatform.com), Try out the new non-turing complete Waves smart contract language Ride by using our IDE.
* [_**Waves console and its commands**_](/technical-details/waves-contracts-language-description/waves-console-commands.md), Waves IDE has a Waves console feature which supports different commands.
* [_**Get to our Tutorials**_](/technical-details/video-tutorials-and-articles.md), We believe that the best way to learn is by practical examples.

## Client Libraries

Waves Client is supported by many libraries, please [_**Get to know our client libraries **_](/development-and-api/client-libraries.md)and use them depending on which language you're familiar with:

* [_**PyWaves for Python**_](/development-and-api/client-libraries/pywaves.md)
* [_**WavesJ for Java**_](/development-and-api/client-libraries/wavesj.md)
* [_**WavesCS for C\#**_](/development-and-api/client-libraries/wavescs.md)
* [_**Waves-API for TypeScript/JavaScript**_](https://github.com/wavesplatform/waves-api)
* [_**WavesC**_](/development-and-api/client-libraries/waves-c.md)
* [_**Community Libraries**_](/development-and-api/client-libraries/unofficial-libraries.md)
