## Overview

[_**Get to understand what is a Waves full node**_](/README.md), Nodes are a critical part of Waves ecosystem. By Running a Waves node, you help in processing transactions and you will icrease your profit for securing the network if users start leasing their funds to your node.

The Waves full node serves **two critical roles**:

1. To relay blocks and transactions to miners
2. To answer queries for end users about the state of the blockchain.

You may ask your self two questions:

* _**How much will my node earn?**_, the answer is simple: Since rewards across the entire network are distributed proportionately, the more WAVES you hold in your node, the greater share of blockchain transaction fees you will receive. The final amount will also depend on overall network activity and the level of fees generated \(approximately 2.6 WAVES per month if your balance is 1000 WAVES\).
* _**Is worth it to run a full wave node?, **_Now with FairPoS it will be profitable even with small amounts, if you ever decide to run a node you're helping the whole ecosystem to remain decentralized. FairPoS adds 20% to small node performance. In general it is not practical to run a node with 1k WAVES, unless it's just interesting for you.

## Options

As a node owner, you have different paths and you will need to [_**check the node configuration**_](/waves-full-node/configuration-parameters.md) before following any path:

1. _**Install a node**_

2. _**Upgrade your node**_

3. _**Rollback**_

4. _**Get actual blockchain**_

In addition, if you're interested in joining the Testnet, you will need to follow the steps for [_**joining Testnet.**_](/waves-full-node/joining-testnet.md)

## Install a Node

Help us to power the Waves blockchain by [_**Installing your node**_](/waves-full-node/how-to-install-a-node/how-to-install-a-node.md). A simple hosted server is all the hardware youâ€™ll need.
