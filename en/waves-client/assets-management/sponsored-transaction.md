# How to use sponsored transactions.

Some projects want their users to be able to operate with their tokens without using Waves token at all. Often it makes much sense since these assets have value. Currently, it's impossible to ensure all the miners accept particular asset as a fee.

For these reasons, we implemented a completely new feature called Sponsored Transactions. So, any user who issued their token can use custom fees in official wallets and other apps.

**Note**: Before you start, please make sure that you have at least 2 WAVES on the balance. Since activation and deactivation procedure cost 1 WAVES per request.

**How to activate sponsored transactions**.

Open up your Waves wallet.

Go to the **Portfolio** and find your token.
