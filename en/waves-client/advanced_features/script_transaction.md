# â€‹How to create Script transaction.

Script transactions allow you to extend the available functionality of the standard Waves application. One of the uses of script transaction is creating a multi-signature wallet. For more information, please check the following [article](en/technical-details/waves-contracts-language-description/examples/multi-signature-account.md).
Also, script can be developed with [Waves Ride IDE](https://ide.wavesplatform.com/)

**Before you start, please keep in mind. We do not recommend you submit script transactions unless you are an experienced user. Errors can lead to permanent loss of access to your account**.

So, to start using all available features of the application, first you need to activate the advanced features.

By the way, you can use either online version of the client, or standalone version for Mac, PC or Linux. All versions support automatic update!
Also downloads are available from the official site - https://wavesplatform.com/product

Choose and open your Waves wallet. Click on the **Settings** button (see left bottom corner) ![](/_assets/dark_mode_01.png)
