# Waves Asset Verification Protocol

## Motivation

Waves Platform allows to create and transfer any asset. The only threshold for the creator is to pay a fee (currently 1 waves). This lowers the threshold for entering the platform but opens up a lot of opportunities to send spam at a relatively low price. Also scam assets could be used for fraudulent purposes, for example by duplicating, fully or in part, the name of an existing cryptocurrency or a well-known company with the aim of misleading users.

We want to protect our users from suspecious assets and ensure verified assets are used. It could be possible with some kind of listings generated by token holders with voting system or by a trusted organizations in compliance with established rules, access to which is public.

Here we present a standard that allows the exchange of information about tokens between data providers and applications using the Waves blockchain.

Any company or individual provider can provide information about tokens, verify/certify projects that have issued a token in the Waves blockchain. Any application using the Waves blockchain can use the information provided by the providers.

An example of such provider is [bettertokens](http://bettertokens.org/) - Tokenization Standards Association, a non-profit organization, the main function of them is development of due diligence standards for companies engaged in the tokenization of assets and initial coin offerings (ICO)/ token generation events (TGE). 

## Specification

Our protocol is supposed to serve as an interaction between providers and the blockchain. A provider can be both a centralized organization with a developed methodology and a decentralized service for ranking tokens by voting or multisignature signing. 

Each provider has its own address on Waves blockchain. It can be created specially for the purpose of asset verification or used for other goals as well.

Each provider has its own Waves address. Before starting to supply information about tokens, providers must fill information about themselves as one data entry of DataTransaction. Then, for each token, the provider fills another data entry in the same DataTransaction, with status and detailed information. DataTransaction is sent to smart account address and could be read then as account state. Example of such transaction in JSON format:

```
{
  "version" : 1,
  "sender": "3FjTpAg1VbmxSH39YWnfFukAUhxMqmKqTEZ",

    {"key": "data_provider_name", // provider initialization key

     }, {
     "key": "ticker_<2L3hRkSJpmaytgSfKLSNgC1vcoUvGGAv2353c6V9hPKC>", 
     "type": "string",

     "value": "base64:__base64_image_code__", // project logo 
     }
  ],
  "fee": 100000
}
```
Where `version` is a DataTransaction version of transaction (this information you can find in our documentation),  `sender` is a provider address, `data` consists of data entries each of which contains fields `key`, `type` and `value`, and `fee` is a fee amount in Waves. The token's status can be "scam", "suspicious", "with detailed description", "proven" or "gateway". More detailed information about parameters you can find in the tables below.


Table 1. Tokens statuses


| Status | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| -2 | Scam token |
| -1 | Suspicious token |
| 0 | Token with detailed description |
| 1 | Proven tokens |
| 2 | Gateways |

Table 2. Parameters for the provider description 


| Key | Required | Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| data_provider_name | true | Provider's name |

## Example of a blacklist smart-contract

Here we present an example of a smart-contract which blacklists all transactions with suspicious and scam tokens:
```
let address = …

match tx {
    case tx: BurnTransaction | TransferTransaction | MassTransferTransaction | ReissueTransaction | ExchangeTransaction | SetAssetScriptTransaction => extract(getInteger(address, tx.assetId)) >= 0
    case _ => false
}

```

### Interaction of Waves applications with the protocol

The providers' accounts are specified in the settings so the ranking can be read from the corresponding account's state. So that the user has the opportunity to choose a "good" provider. It is also planned to organize a rating of the providers, determined by users’ voting.

## Settings

The default settings indicate the addresses of bettertokens and the community spam-list.
The user has the ability to add the addresses of their providers.

If a tokenId is present in the several proveders' lists then the user is able to choose the most trusted provider and use this information in the future.
