# About Waves Keeper

Waves Keeper is an extension that allows you to interact with Waves-enabled web services securely from your Chrome browser.

SEEDs and private keys are encrypted and stored within the extension and cannot be accessed by the dApps and services on the web, giving you peace of mind that your funds are always safe from hackers and malicious sites. Completing a transaction doesnâ€™t require entering any sensitive information.

Waves Keeper is designed for convenience, so you can sign transactions with just a couple of clicks. Users can create multiple wallets and switch between them easily, and if you ever forget the password to the account you can recover it from your SEED, as normal.

You can view the source code for Waves Keeper on GitHub, or check it like any other Chrome extension.
