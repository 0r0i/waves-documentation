# 1. Lite Client

[The Waves Lite Client](https://beta.wavesplatform.com) can be [easily installed](https://waves-platform.gitbooks.io/wavesdocs/content/waves-client/install-waves-client.html) and used to perform most actions in the Waves Platform where users can issue, transfer and trade assets.

# 2. Waves Wallet

* It’s a fully-featured client that lets you access all features of the Waves platform.

* It offers fiat integration, fast speeds, an intuitive interface, and custom tokens. It’s also constantly being updated.

* It allows to store, track, transfer and manage your cryptocurrencies, the Tokens that you issue or the Tokens that you acquire.

* The wallet has a built-in decentralized exchange platform that can be used to exchange assets, cryptocurrencies and fiat tokens.

# 4. Decentralized cryptocurrency exchange \(“DEX”\)

[DEX](https://docs.wavesplatform.com/decentralized-cryptocurrency-exchange-dex.html) allows to place and execute orders for buying or selling cryptocurrency or Tokens for another cryptocurrency or exchanging them to other Tokens.

# 5. Nodes

* [Easy to install](https://waves-platform.gitbooks.io/wavesdocs/content/guidelines/how-to-install-a-node.html).
* A hosted server is adequate to run a node and no mining rigs or specialist hardware are required.
* It allows to mine WAVES and MRTs \(Miners Reward Tokens\) and act as a leasing pool to aggregate mining power from other users.
* Receiving rewards from the network by leasing your balance to a full node. 

# 6. Matchers

* Nodes contain an order matcher which is used to power the decentralised exchange.
* Matcher nodes pair buyers and sellers, executing trades instantly whilst still ensuring these are ultimately settled on the blockchain for maximum transparency and security.
* Matchers will receive fees for the service they provide, adding an additional revenue stream for Waves full nodes.

# 7. Mobile apps

* Waves Wallet is a mobile client to WavesPlatform available on [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wavesplatform.wallet) and [IOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/waves-wallet/id1233158971?mt=8).
* The wallet is connected to public Waves nodes in order to retrieve your transactions and send payments.

# 8. Waves Gateways

Fiat Gateways such as USD/EUR/CNY will allow you to exchange any token issued on the Waves platform \(or any other cryptocurrency like BTC/ETH/ZCash/Litecoin\) for “real” money, which can be deposited in a bank. All transactions between cryptocurrency to fiat or fiat to cryptocurrency will be recorded on the Waves blockchain. This is like mixing the best of both worlds \(i.e. centralized systems and decentralized systems\).

## 8.1 Fiat Gateways \(Dollars and Euros\)

The Waves US dollar and EUR gateways are available within the Waves Client — allowing anyone to deposit and withdraw USD, EUR and use the backed token within the Waves ecosystem. Waves users can deposit USD and EUR via the secure gateways, receiving in return a token that is 100% backed by USD or EUR reserves. This can be held, transferred and exchanged for other tokens quickly and at low cost, and withdrawn back through the gateway into the traditional financial system when required.

the USD and EUR gateways offer Waves users an easy way to move money into the blockchain ecosystem, enabling them to invest in tokens and ICOs with fiat. This was always one of the key propositions for the Waves platform: the ability to send and trade with fiat-backed tokens.

**Note.** KYC/AML verification is needed to deposit and withdraw fiat money. However, KYC is not necessary for cryptocurrency transactions.

## 8.2 Crypto Gateways

All currencies listed below are integrated in Waves through gateways. You can see gateways as a means to transfer a currency to a platform.

Current List of crypto gateways:

1. WAVES
2. Bitcoin
3. Ethereum
4. ZCash
5. Litecoin 

WAVES, BTC, ETH, Litecoin \(LTC\), Zcash \(ZEC\) gateways can be used to move these currencies into and out of the Waves blockchain. Once the currencies have been confirmed as received by the gateway, the user’s wallet is credited with a Waves token that is 1:1 backed by the cryptocurrency held within the server.

Fees are minimal and the only delays are those required by blockchain confirmation times.
