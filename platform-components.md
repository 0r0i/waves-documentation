# Waves Platform Components

# 1. Lite Client

[The Waves Lite Client](https://beta.wavesplatform.com) can be [easily installed](https://waves-platform.gitbooks.io/wavesdocs/content/waves-client/install-waves-client.html) and used to perform most actions in the Waves Platform where users can issue, transfer and trade assets.

# 2. Token Generation Tool

It allows to issue special digital items within the Platform \(“Tokens”\).

# 3. Electronic wallet \(“Waves Wallet”\)

* It allows to store, track, transfer and manage your cryptocurrencies, the Tokens that you issue or the Tokens that you acquire.
* The wallet has a built-in decentralized exchange platform that can be used to exchange assets, cryptocurrencies and fiat tokens.

# 4. Decentralized cryptocurrency exchange \(“DEX”\)

It allows to place and execute orders for buying or selling cryptocurrency or Tokens for another cryptocurrency or exchanging them to other Tokens.

# 5. Nodes

* [Easy to install](https://waves-platform.gitbooks.io/wavesdocs/content/guidelines/how-to-install-a-node.html).
* A hosted server is adequate to run a node and no mining rigs or specialist hardware are required.
* It allows to mine WAVES and MRTs \(Miners Reward Tokens\) and act as a leasing pool to aggregate mining power from other users.
* Receiving rewards from the network by leasing your balance to a full node. 

# 6. Networks

* [Create private Waves network](https://waves-platform.gitbooks.io/wavesdocs/content/guidelines/creating-a-private-waves-blockchain-network.html) consisting of one node or more.
* New versions of the Waves Node are tested by the development community on the TestNet cluster.

# 7. Matchers

* Nodes contain an order matcher which is used to power the decentralised exchange.
* Matcher nodes pair buyers and sellers, executing trades instantly whilst still ensuring these are ultimately settled on the blockchain for maximum transparency and security.
* Matchers will receive fees for the service they provide, adding an additional revenue stream for Waves full nodes.
