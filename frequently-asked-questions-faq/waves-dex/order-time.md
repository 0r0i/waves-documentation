# I have placed an order. When it will be filled?

The order time depends only on the selected price. The higher your price from the current market price, the longer your order will not be filled.

If you put sell or buy order by market price, transaction will be processed within few seconds.

So, you need to wait until your order will be filled or you can cancel and create a new one.

Just click on the **X** button ![](/_assets/order_time_01.png) to close opened order if you don't want to wait.
