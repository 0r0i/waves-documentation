# Client libraries

Waves Full Node provides access to the [REST API](waves-node-rest-api/node-api-overview.md) also there are community-driven open source libraries for different programming languages:

* [PyWaves for Python](https://docs.wavesplatform.com/waves-node-rest-api/client-libraries/pywaves.html)
* [WavesJ for Java](https://docs.wavesplatform.com/waves-node-rest-api/client-libraries/wavesj.html)
* [WavesCS for C\#](https://docs.wavesplatform.com/waves-node-rest-api/client-libraries/wavescs.html)
* [Waves-API for TypeScript/JavaScript](https://github.com/wavesplatform/waves-api) 

All libraries are open for contribution and testing.

**Note**: Libraries above can upgrade later than REST API, use them wisely. If you want to use the latest features, please, use REST API directly.

**Note**: To use all features of REST API you have to set up a Full Node. If you want to use basic features you can use public nodes, for example, [https://nodes.wavesnodes.com/](https://nodes.wavesnodes.com/).  
The full list of public nodes is available [here](http://dev.pywaves.org/generators/).
