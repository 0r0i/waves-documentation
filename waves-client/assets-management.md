This Chapter Includes All Details About Issue and Reissue Assets.

Assets Management Chapter includes all details about how to issue your own asset \(generate tokens\) and how to reissue your asset which allows you to create more of the same token in the future to increase the total supply of tokens.

After reading this instruction you will be able to:

1. [Issue an Asset \(Generate Tokens\).](https://docs.wavesplatform.com/waves-client/assets-management/issue-an-asset.html)
2. [ReIssue an Asset.](https://docs.wavesplatform.com/waves-client/assets-management/reissue-an-asset.html)
