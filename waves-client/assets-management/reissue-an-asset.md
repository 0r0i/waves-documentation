# ReIssue an Asset

Before you can re-issue a token, you have to create your own token first.

Please find the guide about how to issue an asset \(token\) [here](/waves-client/assets-management/issue-an-asset.md).

**Note**: Make sure to put the re-issuable option while you're creating your asset. Also, remember that issuing a token costs you 1 WAVE in transaction fees.
