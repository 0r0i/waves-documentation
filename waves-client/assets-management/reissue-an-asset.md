# ReIssue an Asset

Before you can re-issue a token, you have to create your own token first.

Please find the guide about how to issue an asset\(token\) [here](https://waves-platform.gitbooks.io/wavesdocs/content/waves-client/assets-management/issue-an-asset.html).

**Note**: Make sure to put the re-issuable option while you're creating your asset.

Also, remember that issuing a token costs you 1 WAVE in transaction fees.
