# **How to Create an Account**

Choose your unique address avatar and then you have to define a password for your account. The password's sole purpose is to encrypt the SEED so it never leaves your computer in blank text form. Your password protects your account when working on a certain device or browser. It is needed in order to ensure that your seed is not saved in storage. If you forget your password, simply delete the affected address from the list on the main page and restore the account using your SEED. You will go through the same process as just described and be able to set the password.

When you have done so, click on **Continue**.
