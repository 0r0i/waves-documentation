# **How to Create an Account**

The Waves wallet features stable fiat, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Zcash, more than 10,000 Waves-based tokens, one of the fastest blockchains in the cryptosphere and the Waves Decentralized Exchange \(Waves DEX\).

Waves, the native currency within the Waves Platform system, is a Leased Proof of Stake \(LPoS\) cryptocurrency that allows users to earn rewards by hosting a full node or by leasing their balance to a node.

Open up Waves wallet or download it by using either the [Online Client](https://wavesplatform.com/product), [Desktop Client](https://wavesplatform.com/product).

After opening the Waves client for the first time, click **Get Started** to start the process of creating your account

Choose your unique address avatar and then you have to define a password for your account. The password's sole purpose is to encrypt the SEED so it never leaves your computer in blank text form. Your password protects your account when working on a certain device or browser. It is needed in order to ensure that your seed is not saved in storage. If you forget your password, simply delete the affected address from the list on the main page and restore the account using your SEED. You will go through the same process as just described and be able to set the password.

When you have done so, click on **Continue**.
