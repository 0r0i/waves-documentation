# Waves Smart Contract

Our realisation of smart contracts will contain two parts:

1. A smart account language implementation.
2. A foundational layer for developing various decentralised applications and smart contracts on the blockchain, with a built-in Turing-complete programming language.

We see the syntax of our language as functional, similar to F\#: strong and statically typed.
